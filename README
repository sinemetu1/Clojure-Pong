# pong

This is a really basic game written in clojure. Mainly practice for me so that I can become familiar with clojure and also work up to creating a decent sized game.

## Usage

Using leiningen fork the repo. Under the root pong directory do `lein repl` and once the repl loads `(game)` will run the pong game.
